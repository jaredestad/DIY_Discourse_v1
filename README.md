#DIY Discourse
##About
The DIY Discourse project seeks to analyze the relationship between expert and amateur discourse communities by mining the social media website Reddit.

The project was originally inspired by this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/). The dataset provided in this post accounts for ~1.7 billion JSON objects. Each JSON object contains all comment attributes as provided by Reddit's API. Currently, the project only uses the sample dataset of ~53 million JSON objects as storage is an issue. 

The website allows users to search through this dataset of comments based on a variety of attributes. Users can add tags to comments to describe or classify the contents of a comment. In addition to the Reddit API comment attributes, some numerical values such as the number of words and sentences have been computed for each comment. These values are not always correct as specific formatting within the comments interferes with generating accurate values.
