#DIY Discourse
##About
The DIY Discourse project seeks to analyze the relationship between expert and amateur discourse communities by mining the social media website Reddit.

The project was originally inspired by this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/). The dataset provided in this post accounts for ~1.7 billion JSON objects. Each JSON object contains all comment attributes as provided by Reddit's API. Currently, the project only uses the sample dataset of ~53 million JSON objects as storage is an issue.
